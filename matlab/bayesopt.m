% BAYESOPT Optimization (minimization) of target function using bayesian
% optimization.
%
% Usage: [xmin, fmin] = bayesopt(@function_handler, nDimensions, params)
%        [xmin, fmin] = bayesopt(@function_handler, nDimensions, params,
%                                lowerBound, upperBound) 
%
%        [xmin, fmin] = bayesopt('function_name', nDimensions, params)
%        [xmin, fmin] = bayesopt('function_name', nDimensions, params,
%                                lowerBound, upperBound) 
%
%        [xmin, fmin] = bayesoptdisc(@function_handler, validset, params)
%        [xmin, fmin] = bayesoptdisc('function_name', validset, params)
%
%
% nDimensions is the number of dimensions (d) of the query vector.
%
% Params is a struct which have the same fields as the C/C++ interface 
%   (see include/parameters.h)
%
% lowerBound and upperBound should be a d x 1 or 1 x d vectors with
%      the lower and upper bound for each component. (optional, default 0-1)
%
% validset is the set of discrete points for discrete optimization,
%      stacked in a single matrix. Thus, it must be a d x n matrix.
