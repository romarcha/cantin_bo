BayesOpt: A Bayesian optimization toolbox            {#mainpage}
=========================================

This is an efficient, C++ implementation of the Bayesian
optimization methodology for nonlinear-optimization, experimental
design and stochastic bandits. In the literature it is also called
Sequential Kriging Optimization (SKO) or Efficient Global
Optimization (EGO). 

The online HTML version of these docs:
<http://rmcantin.bitbucket.org/html/>

Basically, it uses a distribution over functions to build a
metamodel of the unknown function for we are looking the extrema,
and then apply some active learning strategy to select the query
points that provides most potential interest for the seek. For that
reason, it has been traditionally intended for optimization of
expensive function. However, the efficiency of the library make it
also interesting for many types of functions.

It is intended to be both fast and clear for development and
research. At the same time, it does everything the "right way". For
example:

- latin hypercube sampling is use for the preliminary sampling step
- kernel parameters are trained with the preliminary samples and
  fixed afterwards to avoid bias and divergence
- matrix algebra tricks are used to guarantee that any covariance
  matrix remains SPD and reduce computational cost.
- etc.

Originally, it was developed for as part of a robotics research
project \cite MartinezCantin09AR \cite MartinezCantin07RSS, where a
Gaussian process with hyperpriors on the mean and signal covariance
parameters. Then, the metamodel was constructed using the Maximum a
Posteriory (MAP) of the parameters.

However, the library now has grown to support many more surrogate
models, with different distributions (Gaussian processes,
Student's-t processes, etc.), with many kernels and mean
functions. It also provides different criteria (even some combined
criteria) so the library can be used to any problem involving some
bounded optimization, stochastic bandits, active learning for
regression, etc.
