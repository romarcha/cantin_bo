BayesOpt: A Bayesian optimization toolbox            {#mainpage}
=========================================

BayesOpt is an free, efficient, implementation of the Bayesian
optimization methodology for nonlinear-optimization, experimental
design and stochastic bandits. In the literature it is also called
Sequential Kriging Optimization (SKO) or Efficient Global
Optimization (EGO).

Bayesian optimization uses a distribution over functions to build a
metamodel of the unknown function for we are looking the extrema,
and then apply some active learning strategy to select the query
points that provides most potential interest for the seek. For that
reason, it has been traditionally intended for optimization of
expensive function. However, the efficiency of the library make it
also interesting for many types of functions.

It is intended to be both fast and clear for development and
research. At the same time, it does everything the "right way". For
example:

- latin hypercube sampling is used for the preliminary design step,
- extensive use of Cholesky decomposition and related tecniques to 
  improve numeral stability and reduce computational cost,
- kernels, criteria and parametric functions can be combined to 
  produce more advanced functions,
- etc.
